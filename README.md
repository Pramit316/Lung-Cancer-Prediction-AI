#Lung Cancer Prediction

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model to predict lung cancer. The model is built using Python and various machine learning libraries. This README provides installation instructions and an overview of the project.

## Installation

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git


## Steps
1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pramit316/Lung-Cancer-Prediction-AI.git
cd Lung-Cancer-Prediction-AI
```
2.Navigate to the project directory

Change your current working directory to the project directory.

```bash
cd Lung-Cancer-Prediction-AI
```

2. Install dependencies

Install the required packages using pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run the predictor
This model is pre-trained so simply run the predictor.
```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   After execution, open your web browser and go to `[http://192.168.1.64:8501]` to access the application.

### If you want to train the model on your own:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already installed Jupyter Notebook, you can do so using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**: Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, navigate to the directory where `Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb` is located using your command line or terminal.

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
